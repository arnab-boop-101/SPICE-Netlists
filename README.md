# SPICE-Netlists
SPICE circuit netlists for analog/AMS IPs from Virtuoso/Spectre 
It is optimized for integration in analog IP development, mixed-signal SoCs, and educational design studies.



These are a clean, simulation-ready reference design suitable for **Cadence Virtuoso ADE**, **Spectre**, **HSPICE**, or **Ngspice** environments.
